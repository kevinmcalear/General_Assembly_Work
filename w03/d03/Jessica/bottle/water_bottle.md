# Rspec Water Bottle

Using TDD, develop a class for a Water Bottle given the description of the behavior below:

It starts empty, but you can fill the bottle with water. You can drink from it and get water back unless the bottle is empty. Drinking from the bottle empties it.

When you are done, peruse slides 1 - 20 of this [Rspec resource](http://jakegoulding.com/presentations/rspec-structure/
) which explains more about how to use `context`, `before`, `let`, and `subject`. If it changes how you wrote your tests, go back and refactor your tests.

### Bonus
Change it so that each time you fill the bottle, it is good for 3 sips (it empties after you drink from it 3 times instead of once)
