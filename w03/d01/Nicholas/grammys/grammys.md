# Grammys

Create an app that keeps track of the Grammy winners for various categories over the years.

A grammy has:

* A year
* A category
* A winner

Use TDD to develop the concept of a Grammy. You should define the appropriate class and instance methods in order to build a working program.

Your main.rb program should be able to:

1. `Add a Grammy`
2. `List all Grammys`
3. `Delete a Grammy` (This option will list all the Grammys with number indices, and you choose which one to delete by entering the index.)
4. `Quit`

Your data should persist to a csv file with pipes (|) as the delimiters.

### Bonus

Add these options to your program:

1. `List all Grammys from a given year`
2. `List all Grammys from a certain category`
