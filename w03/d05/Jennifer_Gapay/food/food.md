food# Fridge Management App

We're going to building a fridge management app to keep track of all of our food and drink using ActiveRecord. It may be helpful to review the docs for [ActiveRecord Basics](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) and [ActiveRecord Associations](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html) for this.

### Menu Spec

Your program should have a menu that allows you to perform the following actions:

* (L) List all Fridges
* (A) Add a Fridge
* (D) Delete a Fridge

* (VF) View all food items in a specific fridge
* (AF) Add a food item to a fridge
* (E) Eat a food item from a fridge (delete it)

* (VD) View all drink items in a specific fridge
* (AD) Add a drink item to a fridge
* (CD) Consume PART of a drink from a fridge (update its size in ounces)
* (CA) Consume ALL of a drink from a fridge (delete it)

### Fridge Spec
* has a location
* has a brand
* has a size in cubic feet
* has food in it
* has drinks in it

### Food Spec
* has a name
* has a weight in pounds
* is vegan or not
* has a timestamp of when it was put in the fridge

### Drink Spec
* has a name
* has a size in ounces
* is either alcoholic or not

## Bonus

Read up on [ActiveRecord Validations](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html)

* Fridges don't have to contain food or drink in them, but they must have a location, brand and size. Make sure you validate for these using ActiveRecord.
* You can only have 10 food items in your fridge
* Update you restrictions to only allow 50 total ounces of drinks in your fridge
