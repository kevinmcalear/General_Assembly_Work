# WDI Student Rspec

### Prompt

A student has a nickname, amount of knowledge, and whether they are tired or not. A student starts with a name, 0 knowledge, and full of energy (not tired). A student can choose to either code or take a break. Coding increases your knowledge, but it makes you tired. Coding also does not increase your knowledge if you are tired to begin with. If you take a break, you won't be tired anymore :)

### Bonus

If you plan right before you code, you can code twice in a row without getting tired.
