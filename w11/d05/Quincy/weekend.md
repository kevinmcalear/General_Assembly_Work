### Blog Post

Write a blog post about your group project. As a reminder, one person from your team should write about the experience of working in a team. Our collection is here: https://medium.com/wdi-nyc-jan-2014

### Watch.io

Add functionality to your Watch.io App so that it has a front-end with Backbone Collections and Views. You should be able to add a movie to your watch list, update it as seen, and delete it. When you add a movie to your watch list, its poster should be displayed with it. You should use Todo.ly as a reference, but don't copy and paste!
