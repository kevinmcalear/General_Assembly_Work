# SECOND PROJECT DESCRIPTION

### Objectives of project week:

1. Use the Agile process and tools to manage the collaborative software development process during a sprint.
2. Develop software using the full BDD process.
3. Build a web application with logic both on the client and the server and where data exchange occurs asynchronously between client and server.
4. Conform to a single style across all team members, and follow the principles of good software design.
5. Document your work and share it with the public in an effective and articulate manner.
6. Review and articulate your experience of the team and your place in it.

### Project Requirements:

##### Use the Agile process and tools to manage the collaborative software development process during a sprint:

* The group uses feature branches and pull requests to manage sharing of code.
* The group has a scrum at least once a day, including every morning, and divides work effectively by considering dependencies between stories.

##### Develop software using the full BDD process:

* The group submits User Stories on Pivotal Tracker. Every User Story has a Role, Goal, Reason as well as related details and/or wireframes as relevant.
* The group submits an ERD (data model).
* The group writes acceptance tests that map to user stories, and all tests pass.
* The group writes unit tests (Rspec and Jasmine) where appropriate, and all tests pass.

##### Build a web application with logic both on the client and the server and where data exchange occurs asynchronously between client and server:

* The app has a back-end that stores information to a database.
* The app has a front-end interface with JavaScript logic.
* The app properly separates front and back end concerns and uses AJAX appropriately if necessary.

##### Conform to a single style across all team members, and follow the principles of good software design:

* The app has consistent style & formatting.
* The app is *Tested* (Test Coverage > 80%).
* The app is *DRY*.
* The app has methods and classes that are *Small*.
* The app is *Named* semantically.

##### Document your work and share it with the public in an effective and articulate manner:

* The app has a public GitHub repo with comprehensive README documentation.
* The app is deployed to Heroku.
* Every group member (except one, see below) writes a blog post about something they learned.

##### Review and articulate your experience of the team and your place in it:

* Every group member participates in a retrospective.
* The retrospective leader writes a blog post about the experience.

### Additional Notes

*Setup:*
* master repo w/ instructors as collaborators
* pivotal tracker project w/ instructors as collaborators

*Reqs:*
* fork/pull request model of collaboration
* instructors will answer questions via GitHub issues on the master repo
* Wednesday 3/19 is planning day. Decide on features and write user stories. Can start coding if stories are written
