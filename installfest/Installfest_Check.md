## Checkpoints to see if you computer is configured correctly

Most necessary:

* When you type `brew doctor` into your terminal, you get no warnings
* When you type `ruby -v` into your terminal, you get `ruby  2.1.0`
* When you type `pry` into your terminal, it changes the prompt to `[1] pry(main)>`

Sublime:

* When you type `subl` into your terminal, it opens up Sublime Text
* When you have Sublime open and press (Mac) `CMD+Shift+P` or (Ubuntu) `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type `install`, you get the option to `Package Control: Install Package`

Files:

* You have your .gitignore-global, .gitconfig, .bash_profile set up and they match the ones in the class repo
* When you type `cd ~/dev/wdi` and then `ls`, you see our class files

Optional:

* (Mac) You have Spectacle installed on your computer and can use it to manage your windows
* (Before we begin GitHub) Your ssh keys are set up (see https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys for instructions)
