# Rail Fence Cipher

You're going to implement a simple [Rail Fence Cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_fence)

Write a function `encode` that takes a string and encodes it using a Rail Fence Cipher with 3 rails. You can assume no spaces and all input is valid.

### Bonus

* Write an encode function were you can specify the number of rails you want
* Write a decode function

### Just for fun

When you are successful writing an encode function, open up the `index.html` file. In the console, call the `play` function and pass in as an argument the encoded output of "youknownothing"
