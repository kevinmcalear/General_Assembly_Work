# Stop Watch

* When "Start" is clicked, the "Stop Watch" text should be replaced by "Time elapsed: 1", which increments every second.
* When "Reset" is clicked, the text should display "Stop Watch"
* When "Pause" is clicked, the text should say "Time elapsed: 1", but stop incrementing.

Look at [JavaScript Timers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Timers) and check out setInterval and clearInterval.

### Objective
- Use setinterval & clearinterval to repeatedly execute code at specific intervals
