# Part 2 - Self-Assessment
* Update your self-assessment document
* Increase the number of learning objectives you feel confident in by 10

# Part 3 - Reading
* Research window.onload vs $(document).ready():
  1. write about when to use them, compare and contrast them and other methods of setting global events tied to the DOM lifecycle -- *add this to your pull request*,
  2. and then utilize them in the TicTacToe and/or LOTR homeworks.
