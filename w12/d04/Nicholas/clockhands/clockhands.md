# Clock Hands

Write a function that given the time of the day in hours and minutes returns the angle between the hands on a clock.

### Notes:
* It should give a positive angle and return the smaller one (ie less than 180 degrees).
* You can assume that the clock only moves once each minute on the minute to update its hands.
