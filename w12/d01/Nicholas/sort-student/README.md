# Sorting Algorithms

## Learning Objectives
* Explain what an algorithm is
* Describe how a Bubble Sort is performed and it's time complexity
* Describe how a Quick Sort is performed and it's time complexity
* Explain what a divide and conquer algorithm is

## To do

* Run the `benchmark.rb` Ruby file. It compares the sorting time for a bubble sorting algorithm vs. Ruby's built in array sort method.

* Compare the bubble sort code with our understanding of how bubble sort works and the [pseudo code listed on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort). Make sure you understand how it works.

* In the `lib/sort.rb` file you'll find a stub for a quick sort method. Your job will be to fill out that method based on the pseudocode for the "Simple version" of Quick Sort [listed on wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Algorithm). If you've implemented it successfully, it should pass the test when you run Rspec.

* Copy and paste your working quick_sort method into the `benchmark.rb` file. I've saved a spot for it. Uncomment out the part of the benchmark that runs the quicksort code. Run the benchmark and compare the results.

## Bonus

* Check out the "In-place version" of Quicksort listed on wikipedia. Why do you think that version is faster? Try rewriting another quick_sort algorithm using the in-place version of quicksort. Benchmark it and see if there is a difference.
