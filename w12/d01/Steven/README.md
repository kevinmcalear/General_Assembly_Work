# 12 days of Christmas

* Use recursion to write a function that prints out the lyrics for one verse
* Write a function that prints out the lyrics for the entire song

### Tips
* Don't worry about the ordinal numbers. It can say "On the 1 day of Christmas". Fix this for bonus.
* Don't worry about there not being an "and" for "and a Partridge in a Pear Tree" for the first day. Fix this for bonus.
