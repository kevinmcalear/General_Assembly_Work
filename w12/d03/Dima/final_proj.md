# Final Project

### Goal:

###### Create a portfolio piece to demonstrate your abilities to the community and potential employers

### Project Requirements:

###### Develop software using the full BDD process:

* Track User Stories on Pivotal Tracker. Every User Story has a Role, Goal, Reason as well as related details and/or wireframes as relevant.
* Write acceptance tests that map to user stories, and all tests pass.
* Writes unit tests (Rspec and Jasmine) where appropriate, and all tests pass.

###### Model the application effectively and determine where logic should go

* Create an ERD (data model).
* The app properly separates front and back end concerns.

###### Conform to a single style across all team members, and follow the principles of good software design:

* The app has consistent style & formatting.
* The app is *Tested* (Test Coverage > 80%).
* The app is *DRY*.
* The app has methods and classes that are *Small*.
* The app is *Named* semantically.

###### Document your work and share it with the public in an effective and articulate manner:

* The app has a public GitHub repo with comprehensive README documentation (Description, Heroku Link, Pivotal Tracker Link, ERD).
* The app is deployed to Heroku.
