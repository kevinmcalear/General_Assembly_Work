# Poker

I've written a bunch of ugly code that makes the test pass. Your job will be to refactor the code.

Individual cards are described as a string with a combination of two characters:
  * The first represents the value : A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,T,J,Q,K
  * The second represends the suit: s,h,d,c

Remember the principles of good software design
  * DRY
  * Naming
  * Test
  * Small

Other things to consider
  * Formatting & Indentation
  * Readability
  * Consistency
  * Encapsulation where appropriate
