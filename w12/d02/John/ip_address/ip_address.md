# Valid IP?

Write a method that takes a string as input. It should return true if
the input is a valid IPv4 address (ie. anything between `0.0.0.0` and
`255.255.255.255` is valid).

Write the solution in the language of your choice. 

Make sure your code is
* Tested
* DRY
* Named semantically
* Small

If you feel VERY satisfied with your code, implement the solution in another language
