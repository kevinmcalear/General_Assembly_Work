#### Mechanics
- Use boolean logic (&&, ||, !) to combine and manipulate boolean statements
- Use if, else, elsif statements to control logic flow in a Ruby program
- Use Ruby case statements
- Use while loops to execute code multiple times

  - `to` and `not_to`
  - `eq`, `eql`, `equal`
  - `be_true`, `be_false`

## Domain Modeling

#### Concepts
- Explain what a "domain" is, how it is different from a "problem", and why we would want to model it into a problem.

#### Mechanics
- Model a "domain" into a "problem" by listing its parts (entities, relationships, attributes and behavior). 
- Use the TDD/BDD process to transform a problem into code.
