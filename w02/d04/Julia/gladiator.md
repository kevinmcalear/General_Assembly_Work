* The arena name should be capitalized
* An arena can have gladiators
* You can add a gladiator to the arena
  * The arena should never have more than 2 gladiators in it at a time

* If there are two gladiators in the arena, you can call a fight method that will kill one of the gladideators and remove them from the arena.

  * Winning conditions:
    * Trident beats Spear
    * Spear beats Club
    * Club beats Trident
    * If the two gladiators have the same weapon, they both die.

### Bonus

* Add a method to remove gladiators from the arena by name

* Update your winning conditions so that if the gladiator named "Maximus" is in the fight, he should always win.

* Add a method to check to see if the crowd is entertained (.entertained?). The crowd is only entertained if Maximus is in the arena.

* When a fight is over, before the gladiator is killed and removed, the user should be prompted to put their thumbs up or down. If they vote down, remove the losing gladiator from the arena. If they vote up, the gladiator stays alive in the arena.
