# Scrabble

### Installing Rspec

* To install RSpec, type `gem install rspec` into your terminal. Once it is done installing, don't worry about doing anything with it now. We'll come back to it after you've written some code.

###Prompt

* Work in the `lib/scrabble.rb file`

* If you've never played the game Scrabble before, you may want to ask your neighbor about the rules of the game and how words are scored.

* Define a class named ScrabbleWord with an `initialize` method that takes one argument, `word`, and stores it in an instance variable `@word`.

* Write a "getter" for this instance variable `@word` that returns the word as a lowercase string.

1. Define a method `.score` that returns the scrabble score of the word.

2. Define a method `.multiplier_score` that takes a multiplier as an argument and returns a multiplied value of the score. (Think double or triple word score.)

Here are the letter values. Think about how you might put this data in a usable format for your methods above.

```
 scrabble = {
  :a => 1, :b => 3, :c => 3, :d => 2, :e => 1,
  :f => 4, :g => 2, :h => 4, :i => 1, :j => 8,
  :k => 5, :l => 1, :m => 3, :n => 1, :o => 1,
  :p => 3, :q => 10, :r => 1, :s => 1, :t => 1,
  :u => 1, :v => 4, :w => 4, :x => 8, :y => 4,
  :z => 10}
```

###RSpec

* Run RSpec to test your code. To run it, type `rspec` into your terminal in the current directory (the one where you can see the `lib` and `spec` folders)
* Fix any errors that come up. Once you are seeing all green text, try to refactor your methods to make them clearer / more concise. Re-run rspec to make sure your code still works.

#### Bonus

* Tinker around with the `spec/scrabble_spec.rb` file and try different test cases.
