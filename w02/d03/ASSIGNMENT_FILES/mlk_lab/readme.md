## MLK Day Lab

### Red -> Green

Now that you have an understanding of what Rspec syntax looks like, and that you can follow the red -> green (-> refactor) process by reading the output of an Rspec file, let's put TDD to work!

In the `spec/` folder is an Rspec file with the contents of MLK's famous "I have a dream speech." The only problem is: all of his dreams are turning up failures right now. Your job is to make each of those dreams a reality -- let's meet some expectations!

The Rspec is, itself, a bit complex. Don't try to understand every part of it! The purpose of this lab is to begin to implement the idea that you take one test at a time, and write only the code necessary to make that test pass. There are no predetermined requirements that you can turn to in order to overthink the design of your final program. You are just going to write the necessary code to fix the error you are getting or make the test pass.

The process is utmost. Read your errors! They will guide you. You will learn from them, and in the end you will have a fully formed suite of classes.

Put your code in `lib/dream.rb`. Run `rspec` from the current directory.
