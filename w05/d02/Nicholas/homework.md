Use the following documentation to DRY up your Tunr app.

## Path and URL helpers

Instead of using `<a>` tags, we can use use the `link_to` helper in Rails. Read more about it here:

* http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#method-i-link_to

Also, instead of writing out all of our paths by hand, we can use path helpers to refer to our paths:

* http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#generating-paths-and-urls-from-code

You can view a list of all your routes by typing `rake routes` into your terminal.

You can learn more about rake routes and routing from this blog post that PJ wrote:
