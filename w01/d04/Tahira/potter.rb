## Test that code is working
puts characters
puts characters.count
puts names(characters)
puts multiple_mentions(characters)
puts houses(characters)
puts one_word_names(characters)
puts num_in_house("Hufflepuff", characters)
puts weasleys_badger(characters)
puts first_name_y(characters)
puts reverse_slytherin(characters)
puts ""
puts unique_last("Gryffindor", characters)


# * Return an array with the unique last names of all the characters from Gryffindor (ie, print Weasley only 1 one time)


# ### Bonus

# * Return an array with all of the characters' names whose name contains "ll" somewhere
# * Return an array with all of the characters' names whose name contains multiple k's
# * Return an array with all of the characters whose first name begins with the same letter as their last name, sorted alphabetically (ie "Bathilda Bagshot". Note: "Nearly Headless Nick" counts here!)

# ### Tips:
# * Try to minimize your use of ".each". In most of these cases, there will be another enumerable method that will be a better tool for the job!
# * Ruby Docs for Array, String, and Enumerable are your friend!
