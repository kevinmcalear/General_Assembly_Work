#Guess the number

###Prompt:
- Create a ruby file `guess_the_number.rb`
- You are to generate a basic "guess my number" game.  The computer will pick a random number between 0 and 10.  The user will guess the number until they guess correctly.

###Specification:
- The user should be asked to guess a number
- If the user's guess is correct, the user should see a congratulatory message
- If the user's guess is not correct, the user should be asked to guess the number again.
- This should be done in a new file called guess_the_number.rb

###Bonuses
- When the user guesses incorrectly, tell them whether they guess too high or too low
- When the user guesses the number correctly, tell them how many guesses it took them.
