Write a method `twisted_fizzbuzz` that takes a single number as an argument.

* It should print out numbers divisible by 3 that are less than that number
* It should print out numbers divisible by 5 that are less than that number
* It should NOT print out numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 that are less than that number
* It should not return anything

def twisted_fizzbuzz(num)
  for i in (0..num)




  if num % 3 == 0 && num < num/3
    print num
