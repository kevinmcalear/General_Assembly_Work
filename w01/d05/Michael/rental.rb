##Building Details.  Used in Step 1. 
def view_building_details(building)

      puts "There are #{building.building_apartment_array.count} rooms"  
    else " "
    end 
end

## Create an Apartment.  Used in Step 2. 
def create_apartment_form(building)
  apartment_name = Apartment.new
  apartment_hash = Hash.new
  puts "What is the name of the apartment"
    apartment_name.apartment_name= gets.chomp

    apartment_hash[:renter] = []
  #Add Apartment to the Building Array
  building.create_building_apartment_array(apartment_hash)  
end

## Apartment List.  Used in Step 3 to assign an apartment to a user. 
## Only shows available rooms
def apartment_name_list (building)
  apartment_name_array = []
  building.building_apartment_array.each {|hash|

## Create a tenant.  Used in Step 3. 
def create_tenant(building)
  person_name = Person.new

    person_name.name= gets.chomp
  puts "What is the person's age?"
    person_name.age= gets.chomp

  ##Display list of apartments and select one
  puts "Which apartment do they live in?" 
  puts "#{apartment_name_list(building)}"
  apartment_for_tenant = gets.chomp
  ##Step 1:  Create an array with the hash of the exact apartment
  apartment_hash_to_modify = building.building_apartment_array.select {|hash| hash[:name] == apartment_for_tenant}
  ##Step 2:  Using the array from step 1:, determine the array index. 
  index = building.building_apartment_array.index(apartment_hash_to_modify[0])
  ##Step 3:  Using the array index, insert a new hash. 
  building.building_apartment_array[index.to_i][:renter].push = [person_name.name]
end

## Remove a tenant from the building. Used in Step 4. 
def remove_tenant(building)
  view_apartment_detail(building)
  puts "Which tenant would you like to remove?"
  tenant_to_remove = gets.chomp
  ##Step 1:  Create an array with the hash of the exact apartment
  apartment_hash_to_modify = building.building_apartment_array.select {|hash| hash[:renter].include? tenant_to_remove}
  ##Step 2:  Using the array from step 1:, determine the array index. 
  index = building.building_apartment_array.index(apartment_hash_to_modify[0])
  ##Step 3:  Remove the tenant
  building.building_apartment_array[index.to_i][:renter].delete(tenant_to_remove)
end

## Apartment_directory.  Used in Step 5. 
def view_apartment_detail(building)
  i = 0
  while i < building.building_apartment_array.length 
    if building.building_apartment_array[i][:renter].length == 0
