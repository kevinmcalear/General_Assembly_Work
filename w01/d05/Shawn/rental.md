arr#Rental App

###Prompt:
You will be creating an app that models the rental process. What types of objects might you have in an app that manages rentals? We are going to have a building, apartments and people.

### Part 1 - Creating the classes

Create each of the classes for Person, Apartment, and Building

A person should have the following attributes:

* name
* age
* gender

An apartment should have the following attributes:

* name
* price
* sqft
* num_beds
* num_baths
* renter (the person living in the apartment)

A building should have the following attributes:

* name
* address
* num_floors
* apartments

You should determine what methods & behavior are needed for each of your objects. It may help to look at the functionality required below.

### Part 2 - Creating the program functionality & menu display

* The program should instantiate a new building when it starts
* The program should display the following menu options
  * View building details
  * Add an apartment to the building
  * Add a tenant
  * List the apartment directory for the building
  * Quit
* The program should return to the menu until the user quits

#### View Building details
* Tell the user the name, address, number of floors and number of apartments for the building

#### Adding an apartment to the building
* Make sure to get the appropriate input from the user to create your apartment
* Add the new apartment to the building

#### Adding a tenant to an apartment
* Make sure to get the appropriate input from the user to create your person
* Make sure to ask which apartment they want to live in
* Add the person to that apartment
* __NOTE:__ Only one person can live in each apartment (at least until you get to the bonus)

#### Listing the apartments
* List all of the apartments
* If the apartment is unoccupied(no renters) you should say something like:
  `Apt 1A is 750 sqft and has 1 bed and 1 bath. It costs $2500 a month`
* If the apartment is occupied by a tenant, you should say something like:
  `Jeff lives in Apt 1A`

### Bonus
* Increase the number of people that can live in each apartment to up to the number of bedrooms in the apartment. Adjust the rest of your program accordingly.
* Add functionality so that a tenant can leave the building.
