# #Rental App

# ###Prompt:
# You will be creating an app that models the rental process. What types of objects might you have in an app that manages rentals? We are going to have a building, apartments and people.

# ### Part 1 - Creating the classes

# Create each of the classes for Person, Apartment, and Building

# A person should have the following attributes:

# * name
# * age
# * gender

# An apartment should have the following attributes:

# * name
# * price
# * sqft
# * num_beds
# * num_baths
# * renter (the person living in the apartment)

# A building should have the following attributes:

# * name
# * address
# * num_floors
# * apartments

# You should determine what methods & behavior are needed for each of your objects. It may help to look at the functionality required below.

# ### Part 2 - Creating the program functionality & menu display

# * The program should instantiate a new building when it starts
# * The program should display the following menu options
#   * View building details
#   * Add an apartment to the building
#   * Add a tenant
#   * List the apartment directory for the building
#   * Quit
# * The program should return to the menu until the user quits

# #### View Building details
# * Tell the user the name, address, number of floors and number of apartments for the building

# #### Adding an apartment to the building
# * Make sure to get the appropriate input from the user to create your apartment
# * Add the new apartment to the building

# #### Adding a tenant to an apartment
# * Make sure to get the appropriate input from the user to create your person
# * Make sure to ask which apartment they want to live in
# * Add the person to that apartment
# * __NOTE:__ Only one person can live in each apartment (at least until you get to the bonus)

# #### Listing the apartments
# * List all of the apartments
# * If the apartment is unoccupied(no renters) you should say something like:
#   `Apt 1A is 750 sqft and has 1 bed and 1 bath. It costs $2500 a month`
# * If the apartment is occupied by a tenant, you should say something like:
#   `Jeff lives in Apt 1A`

# ### Bonus
# * Increase the number of people that can live in each apartment to up to the number of bedrooms in the apartment. Adjust the rest of your program accordingly.
# * Add functionality so that a tenant can leave the building.
