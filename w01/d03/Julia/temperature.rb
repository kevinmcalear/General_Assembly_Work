Celsius Temperature Converter
- This should be done in a new file called temperature.rb
- Write `convert_to_fahrenheit` and `convert_to_kelvin` methods 
that will each take a temperature in Celsius as a parameter and return 
the converted temperature.
- Once you have these methods written, a program that does the following:
  - The user should be asked to enter a temperature in Celsius
  - The user should be asked to enter if they want to convert the temperature to Fahrenheit or Kelvin
  - After these have been entered, the user should be told what the converted temperature is
