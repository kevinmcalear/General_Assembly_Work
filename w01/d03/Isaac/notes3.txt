Data structures
semantic
efficient storage / access to information

Array
list of data
ordered
indexed from 0

array[index]

array pointing to objects:

[6] pry(main)> deli_meats.push(roast_beef)
=> ["roast beef"]
[7] pry(main)> deli_meats
=> ["roast beef"]
[8] pry(main)> roast_beef.upcase!
=> "ROAST BEEF"
[9] pry(main)> deli_meats
=> ["ROAST BEEF"]

Arrays are ordered. .push adds things on to the end of the list. .pop removes things from the end of the list. .shift removes from the beginning of the list.

array.delete(element) will remove all instances of that element
array.index(element) will return the index of the element
array[index] = element will set an element to that index

An array is just a map of references. 
.sample picks out a random element from an arrays

local variable 
global variable: $variable

Methods should have a single purpose that you can explain concisely 

Hashes
associative array
instead of indices we have keys
symbol is similar to a string. they are used as keys - they refer to other things. 
hash[key] = value     sets the value for said key

ennumerables help us iterate through arrays
blocks are similar to methods
you can iterate over hashes too
each returns itself
