#Morning Exercise:

### Days of the week
- This should be done in a new file called days.rb
- The user should be asked to enter what day of the week it (for Monday - Friday)
- Based on their answer, print an approriate reponse (ie TGIF!)

### Tip Calculator
- This should be done in a new file called tip.rb
- The user should be asked to enter the price of their meal
- The user should be asked to enter what the tax percentage is
- The user should be asked to enter what percentage they would like to tip
- After these three options have been entered, the user should see an appropriate displayed output with their total
  - For example:
  `Your total is $15.47`

### Celsius Temperature Converter
- This should be done in a new file called temperature.rb
- Write `convert_to_fahrenheit` and `convert_to_kelvin` methods that will each take a temperature in Celsius as a parameter and return the converted temperature.
- Once you have these methods written, a program that does the following:
  - The user should be asked to enter a temperature in Celsius
  - The user should be asked to enter if they want to convert the temperature to Fahrenheit or Kelvin
  - After these have been entered, the user should be told what the converted temperature is

#####Bonus
- Expand your temperature converter so that you can convert a temperature from any temperature scale (C, F, K) to any temperature scale (C, F, K) as determined by the user. If you get this working, think about ways you could refactor your code to make it either simpler or more readable.
