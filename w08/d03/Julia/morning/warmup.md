# Warmup

* Work the in the warmup.html document for the first 2 exercises.

## Favorite Things

* Create an array that contains a few of your favorite things (fruits, vegetables, colors, sports teams, whatever). 
* Write some code in JavaScript that outputs strings like (for an array of arbitrary length):

```
My #1 favorite thing is Dos Toros.
My #2 favorite thing is Pirates Booty.
My #3 favorite thing is Oatmeal.
``` 

##  Initials

* Define a function `initials` that takes a person's name as input and returns their initials.
* Use loops for this and don't try to use an enumerator like map.
* Use MDN if you need to look up something in the docs.

```
initials('Peter Yi-da Lai');
=> 'PYL'
```

## `this`

Open/run the `this.html` file. Read through the JavaScript and look at what gets printed in the console. See if you can explain why each line of the output prints what it does.
