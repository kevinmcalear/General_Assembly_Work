ATM application
We 're going to build an application to keep track of the checking and savings balances. You can play with an example of what a working version will do in the atm-obfuscate folder.

User Stories

As a user, I want to deposit money into one of the bank accounts
As a user, I want to withdraw money from one of the bank accounts
Make sure the balance in an account can't go negative. If a user tries to withdraw more money than exists in the account, ignore the transaction.
As a user, I want overdraft protection
What happens when the user wants to withdraw more money from the checking account than is in the account?
If a withdrawal can be covered by the balances in both accounts, take the balance of the account withdrawn from down to $0 and take the rest of the withdrawal from the other account.
If the withdrawal amount is more than the combined account balance, ignore it.
As a user, I want the color of my back account to reflect it's balance (there's a CSS class called .zero already written for this!)
Are there ways to refactor your code to make it DRYer or more Object-Oriented?
Tips

Tackle making your accounts work individually first
Then tackle them working together with overdraft protection
Only start working with the DOM after you have the logic down
