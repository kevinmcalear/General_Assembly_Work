    <p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">

      //create an array starting with 1 and 2
      list = [1,2]
      current_term = null
      //until you pass 4 million.
      while (current_term < 4000000) {

        current_term = list[list.length-1]+list[list.length-2]
        list.push(current_term)

      }

      //remove the last number (which is > 4 million)
      list.pop()

      //starting with a total of 0
      total = 0

      //add up all even terms
      for (i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        if (list[i] % 2 == 0)
          total += list[i]
      }
      console.log(list)
      console.log(total)
    </script>
