var currencyFrom = prompt("What currency are you converting from?");
var currencyTo = prompt("What currency are you converting to?");
var amount = prompt("What is the amount you are converting?");

var currencyConverter = function(){
  if (currencyFrom === pounds) {
    return poundsToDollars(amount);
  }
  else (currencyTo === dollars) {
    return dollarsToPounds(amount);
  };
}
