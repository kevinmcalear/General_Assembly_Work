A database is where the bits and bytes of data are physically stored.  
A DBMS is the interface into the database.  
SQL is the language that interfaces with the database.  

ACID compliance ensures that all database procedures are completed fully.  A database that is not ACID compliant would allow part of a process to run (and a few records to be deleted) before fully completing.  

The Object Relational Mapper allows the developer to create records via meta-programming from objects that are instantiated from within a program.   The newly created records have their attributes properly mapped to the table columns as well as have their referential integrity validated from within the application. 

Active Record is an example of an ORM. 


Data that is stored in memory will be lost once the server session is ended.  
Data stored in the database persist can be accessed across session.  An example would be an object instantiated: 
Object.new

The object could be passed to the DB: 
Object.new
Object.save

or the object could be created and passed to the DB: 
Object.create
