#Week 4 - Intro to Web Applications

###What did we do last week?
- We learned about databases and persistent storage. We learned about how to design schemas and use SQL to access and manipulate our data. Toward the end of the week, we learned about ActiveRecord, which allows us to access our database without writing much SQL and maps our objects to our database tables.
