#Sinatra Routing App

####Objectives:

- Practice routing, passing parameters, and ERB Templates

#### Prompt

- You are going to recreate your own version of the [pair programming bot](http://pairprogrammingbot.com/) from scratch using Sinatra. The web app should follow a flowchart. Each page will either have a Yes/No option or Done option which links to another page. 

- Ignore the stuff on that site about "Inspiration" & "run tests".

- Your program should mimic the HTML of the web site, but don't worry about styling it using CSS.

#### Planning

- Map out your program first. ie BEFORE you start coding. It will be helpful to draw a flow chart.

- You should use ERB templates to keep your code DRY. What types of pages will you need a template for?

- For each of the templates that you are going to use, what information do you need to pass in using an instance variable?

- How many / which pages do you need? What template type is each page going to be?
