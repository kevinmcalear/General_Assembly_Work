#OH NO

Hogwarts has lost all its magic and now NOTHING WORKS!

## First
You are part of Dumbledore's army. Correct all the errors so that this app runs properly.

* __Lumos!__ To help lead the way, I can tell you that there are no errors with the database schema / migrations and the CSS is fine too. The models, views, controllers, seed file and routes may be cursed though so watch out!
* __Accio error!__ I've added `better_errors` to the Gemfile to help you find and summon the errors more quickly.


## Then
Add functionality so students can enroll at Hogwarts (Creating a new student). You should implement a sorting hat method to randomly assign new students to one of Hogwarts' four houses. (Where do you think this logic should go?)
