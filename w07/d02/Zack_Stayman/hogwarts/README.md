#OH NO

Hogwarts has lost all its magic and now NOTHING WORKS!

## First
You are part of Dumbledore's army. Correct all the errors so that this app runs properly.

## Then
Add functionality so students can enroll at Hogwarts (Creating a new student). You should implement a sorting hat method to randomly assign new students to one of Hogwarts' four houses. (Where do you think this logic should go?)
