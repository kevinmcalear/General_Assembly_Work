      <p>I am a designer by trade that looks at the things I am surrounded by everyday for inspiration. I find that I am heavily influenced by the world around me and that is what makes me really enjoy photography. I love to capture what I see in everyday life and make it my own through my work. I feel that the designer within me helps with my composition, while making me aware of my surroundings. I take this thinking into my home, where I enjoy designing the interior as well as building and improving the things that need attention. I live with my wife and two sons in the East Bay of San Francisco. We enjoy traveling around the west coast, and sometimes further, exploring and making new adventures for ourselves.
