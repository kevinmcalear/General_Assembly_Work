#Comprehensive Lab - Red.it

We've learned a ton about The Agile Process, Behavioral-Driven Development, Ruby on Rails,  HTML & CSS over the past few weeks. Before we move on to JavaScript, we wanted to give you guys an opportunity to put all of these skills together on a new project to really solidify them.

The app concept is called Red.it. It is a link sharing app that allows users to submit links to be shared with other users. Users can upvote and downvote links, and the most popular links get bubbled to the top. The concept is based off of Reddit or Hacker News.

We put together a rough list of user stories for this app here and have included a CSV that you can import to start a Pivotal Tracker Project:

We will be taking questions for additional requirements gathering and clarification.

#### Notes

* We will be working on this lab all day today.
* You will be pair-programming.
* Create this project in a new public repo (Not WDI_NYC_12)
