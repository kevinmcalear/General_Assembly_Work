#Hexadecimal

From Wikipedia:

In mathematics and computer science, hexadecimal (also base 16, or hex) is a positional numeral system with a radix, or base, of 16.
It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or alternatively a–f) to represent values ten to fifteen. 

Hexadecimal numbers are also used to create hex codes for colors: http://color.hailpixel.com/
